# Investigating the Number of Crimes in Different Toronto Neighbourhoods

## Overview

This repo creates a short paper that analyzes the ratio estimates using data of education in the USA. The code identifies the ratio of individuals with doctoral degrees and the total population. This was used to generate the ratio estimate of doctoral degrees for each of the states, which was then compared to the true ratio of doctoral degrees in the entire country to validate this estimate. Results indicated that the ratio estimate was an accurate predictor of the true number of doctoral degrees.
